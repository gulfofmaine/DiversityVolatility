##### This data file contains the imputed landed value for commercial marine fisheries by year, state, and species for the Northeast U.S. region.  Sub-regions of Northern New England, Southern New England, and Mid Atlantic are also identified.  These data support regional-scale analyses of revenue diversity and volatility used in Kennedy et al. (in review).
